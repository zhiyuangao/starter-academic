We are excited to announce the launch of our new international project [M&#x00B2LInES](https://m2lines.github.io/) --  Multiscale Machine Learning In coupled Earth System Modeling --  aimed at deepening our understanding of climate processes, and improving climate projections using scientific machine learning. Our [team](https://m2lines.github.io/team/) includes scientists from New York University, Princeton, GFDL, Columbia, LDEO, NCAR, MIT, CNRS-IGE, and CNRS-IPSL.  

The overall goal of the project is to improve climate projections and reduce climate model biases, especially at the air-sea interface, using machine learning (ML). We will rely on data from a range of high-resolution (idealized and global) simulations and data assimilation products to deepen our understanding and improve the representation of subgrid physics in the ocean, sea-ice and atmosphere components of existing IPCC-class climate models. In addition, we will work on overcoming challenges related to ML for climate modeling including sampling efficiency, generalization, interpretability and uncertainty quantification. 

We are looking for 1 project manager and 12 postdocs right now at several institutions, please visit [https://m2lines.github.io/jobs/](https://m2lines.github.io/jobs/) for more info about the different positions available, and how to apply. This is a highly collaborative project, and the researchers are expected to interact with different groups.
