- Our new
  [paper](https://laurezanna.github.io/files/pdf/Zanna_et_al-2018-QJRMS(1).pdf)
  on "Uncertainty and Scale Interactions in Ocean Ensembles" was
  accepted in QJRMS

- Congrats to [Tomos
  David](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/david) who just
  completed his PhD with us, and for his latest
  [paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/aad19a/meta)
  in J. of Stat Mech on eddy-mixing entropy in forced-dissipative
  geostrophic turbulence
