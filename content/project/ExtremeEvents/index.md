We observe and predict a range of extremes events in precipitation,
sea level, and air or ocean temperatures. Some of these events are
rare but are of large amplitudes. Sampling their statistics and
undertanding their dynamical drivers are important for climate
detection, attribution and adaption. These extreme events are a
reflection of the complex and non-linear dynamics governing the
climate system. We are interested in addressing the following: 

- What are the dynamical drivers of the extreme events in sea surface
  temperatures or sea level? (e.g., [Rodrigues et al. 2019](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/rodrigues-et-al-2019/), Yin et al. 2019)

- How anthropogenic climate change has affected or will affect extreme
  events in the ocean and atmosphere?

- How to best describe forced-dissipative turbulent system from their
  statistics? (e.g., [David et al. 2018](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/david-et-al-2018/), [David et al. 2017](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/david-et-al-2017/))
