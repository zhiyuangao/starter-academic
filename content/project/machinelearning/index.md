We work on data-driven methods to undertand and predict climate. The tools we use range from probabilistic models informed by data to machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks).

Some of our data-driven work include: 

-- Simple statistical models for prediction of seasonal to decadal sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic (e.g., [Zanna 2012](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/zanna-2012/), [Huddart et al. 2016](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/huddart-et-al-2016/)) and Pacific (e.g., [Dias et al. 2018](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/dias-et-al-2018/)), and sea level (e.g., [Fraser et al. 2019](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/fraser-et-al-2019/)).

-- Data-driven scale- and flow-aware  determinitic and stochastic parametrizations of ocean turbulence (e.g., [Porta Mana & Zanna 2014](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/portamana-zanna-2014/), [Zanna et al. 2017](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/zanna-et-al-2017/), [David et al. 2017](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/david-et-al-2017/)).

-- Data inference using machine learning (e.g., [Bolton and Zanna, 2019](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/bolton-zanna-2018/)).

-- Representation of climate processes with Neural Net and Equation-Discovery (e.g., [Bolton and Zanna, 2019](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/bolton-zanna-2018/), [Bolton and Zanna, 2019](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/bolton-zanna-2018/)).

We are actively using machine learning and more generally data-driven tools to address some of our favorite problems related to parameterization of turbulent processes, interannual to decadal prediction, and forecasting of extreme events.
