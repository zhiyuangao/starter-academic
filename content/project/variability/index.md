In addition to its role played in heat and carbon uptake, the
large-scale ocean circulation in the Atlantic is an important driver
of European climate variability on interannual and decadal
timescales. Yet, the importance of its influence remains unclear due
in part to the short historical record and the poor representation of
this variability in climate simulations. To explore the large
discrepancies between coupled general circulation models (GCMs) in
their representation of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC)
decadal variability and predictions in the Atlantic sector, we have
introduced new diagnostic and numerical tools. Some of the questions
we are interested include:

-- Which processes (e.g., atmosphere, ocean mixed layer, ocean
   currents) drive decadal variability (e.g., Atlantic Multidecadal
   Variability)?  (e.g., [MacMartin et al. 2013]
   (https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/macmartin-et-al-2013/),
   [O’Reilly et al. 2016]
   (https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/oreilly-et-al-2016/))

-- Why is the decadal ocean variability in model low compared to
   observations? ([O'Reilly and Zanna,
   2018](https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/oreilly-zanna-2018/))

-- How remote variability in the Tropical Pacific impacts European
   weather?  (e.g.,
   [O’Reilly et al. 2018]
   (https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/oreilly-et-al-2018/))

-- What are the roles of air-sea feedback at high-latitudes? (e.g.,
   [O’Reilly et al. 2016]
   (https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/oreilly-et-al-2016/))

-- How does anthropogenic forcing impact the variability of ocean
circulation?  (e.g., [MacMartin et al. 2016]
(https://laurezanna.github.io/publication/macmartin-et-al-2016/))
